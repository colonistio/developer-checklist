    - PR Title should be as short and concise as possible
1. PRs submitted during your time at Colonist follow a strict format and criteria, both for the [PR description](/docs/pr-format.md), and code quality
1. Before submitting a PR, ensure it abides by [Developer fundamentals](/docs/developer/developer-fundamentals.md), [Developer Intermediate](/docs/developer/developer-intermediate.md), and [Developer advanced](/docs/developer/developer-advanced.md)
